Working with forms and the HTML elements is a common task you can expect to perform as a developer in .NET MVC. In this post, I will show you how you can use forms to successfully pass information from the frontend to the backend for processing. So without further adieu, let’s jump in! 

## What are Tag Helpers

In .NET MVC, tag helpers enable values to pass from the HTML form element to the controller. Basically,  they help you to create and render HTML elements by the use of server-side code. This makes code more easier to understand and quicker to develop. For a robust explanation of tag helpers and how they work, you can read an article by Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-9.0). 

## How Are Values Passed From a Form Element 

To pass a value from a form element to the backend, you’ll use a form tag helper. It generates a HTML <form> element with action attribute values for interaction with a MVC controller action.

For example, in my blog application you can create a comment using a form in the **Create.cshtml** file for the Comments view, which you can see below: 

```html  
<form asp-controller=”Comments” asp-action="Create" method=”post”>  
   <!-- Input and Submit elements -->  
</form>  
```

The Form Tag Helper above generates the following HTML:

```html  
<form method="post" action="/Comments/Create">  
    <!-- Input and Submit elements -->  
</form>  
```  
As you can see, MVC generates the **action** attribute value from the form tag helper attributes **asp-controller** and **asp-action.** 

When the submit button is pressed, the form is submitted to the **Create** action of the **Comments** controller, where values are passed using the **Comment** model as shown in the example below.

```csharp  
[HttpPost]   
public Create([Bind("PostId,Body")] Comment comment)  
{  
 // Omitted for brevity  
}  
```  
In the code you see that the **Create** action has a **HttpPost** attribute which signals the MVC runtime environment that we are going to write data. You can also see a **Comment** parameter with a **Bind** attribute is passed to the **Create** action from the form. 

The **Bind** attribute ensures that the **PostId** and **Body** properties on the **Comment** parameter are always passed to the **Create** action. If they are missing, then an error will occur and the **Create** action will not execute in creating a comment. 

## Wrapping Up

You are now more knowledgeable of how values are passed from HTML forms in .NET. Microsoft developed a unique way to pass values in MVC, resulting in a more efficient and simple process.
